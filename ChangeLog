	Fixing issues with the last checkin.  Full IV and Cver regressions
	now pass.  Added diagnostic to verify signal merging works
	properly.  Still need to finish race condition and FSM merging.

	Last change needed to fix merging dissimilar functional units that
	have different statements/expressions.	This should also work for
	dissimilar signals too.  Need to add support for merging dissimilar
	FSMs.  Also need to change CDD version number and update all
	regression files.  Checkpointing.
